    	     creation called the Geobond.</p>
	</br>
			<p> She attend Amarillo College studying art. But in the 1970s her major changed
			From once art now technology. It all started with the breaking of her swan 
			sculptor. One day her swan shattered that she had been working on for many months. 
			With that happening she spent 8 years after that trying to create a non breakable 
    	    plaster. She finally created the <a href="http://www.women-inventors.com/Patricia-Billings.asp"  target="_blank"
    	    >Geobond</a>  
    	    which is an indestructible plaster.  The Geobond can resist heat up to 2,000 &deg;F 
    	    flames for about four hours. </p>
