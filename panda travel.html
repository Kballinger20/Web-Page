	<h3>Comments of people who went here:</h3>
		
		<p>It was a wonderful stay! More enjoyable than any hotel in Long Beach! We went on
		 the "Sir Winston's Dining With the Spirits" evening and it was FUN! The food was 
		 great and the tour was spooky! We had a wonderful time!- JDnCooper2 </p>
		 
		 
		 <p>We went to Queen Mary and took there ghost tour and historical tour
There were so cool .the stories of ghosts and haunted cabins were alittle Erie and exciting
 all at the same time.also the history of the ship was so interesting .we loved it very much.
 I think everyone should go at least once.to see history.....- seeslady</p>
 
 
 		<p>The second you step onto the ship you are transported back to a Time when quality 
 		really mattered. You can feel and see the craftsmanship that went into every piece 
 		in building this beautiful ship that still holds up to this day. As I laid on my bed
 		 I closed my eyes and pictured myself steaming across the Atlantic during a time that
 		  has passed. Unfortunately I feel that she will not be here very much longer. It
 		   would take a huge effort to return this beautiful ship back to her original glory. 
 		   I wish Disney would step up and take control over the entire area and turn it into
 		    a second Southern California theme park. Although the future of the ship is unknown 
 		    come down and stay a few nights and transport yourself back in time if for only a 
 		    few days- fordbutcher</p>
 		    
 		   <p>Nice room love that the window opened got a breeze. Got to see outside. It was
 		    clean comfortable bed. Price was really good and not to mention front desk very 
 		    helpful and accommodate me a front room. I will stay here again- Albert Blanca
